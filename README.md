# What is DeFi?

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a system where financial services are done on blockchain, without banks or middlemen. Everything is peer-to-peer and controlled by smart contracts (programs on blockchain that run automatically).

| Feature      | Normal Finance (CeFi)                  | DeFi                                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Control      | Banks or financial institutions        | Users control their money directly             |
| Intermediary | Required (banks, brokers)              | No intermediaries, smart contracts do the work |
| Access       | Limited by country, account, or credit | Anyone with internet & crypto wallet           |
| Transparency | Transactions are mostly private        | Blockchain is public and transparent           |
| Speed        | Slow (depends on bank timings)         | Fast, 24/7, no holidays                        |
| Costs        | High fees for cross-border transfers   | Low fees (depends on blockchain network)       |


# What we can do in DeFi:

## Lending & Borrowing:
   Lend crypto to earn interest.
   Borrow crypto by giving extra crypto as collateral.
## Trading:
   Swap one crypto for another directly, no bank needed.

## Yield Farming:
   Earn rewards by putting your crypto in pools that help platforms work.
## Insurance:
   Protect your crypto from hacks or losses by paying a small fee.


# Problems with Existing Cryptocurrencies
 ## Price Volatility:
   Cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum change value very fast.
  Example: BTC can go up or down 10% in a single day.
  Makes them hard to use for payments, trading, or loans.
 ## Not Reliable for Daily Transactions:
   If you pay with BTC today, its value could drop tomorrow.
   People can lose money unintentionally.
 ## Difficult for Lending & Borrowing:
   Lenders risk losing value if crypto prices drop.
   Borrowers need to deposit extra collateral due to volatility.
 ## Limited Adoption for Businesses:
   Businesses don‚Äôt want to accept crypto that keeps changing value.
   Hard to use for salaries, payments, or savings.


# ‚úÖ Why Stablecoins Solve This:
  Stablecoins are pegged to real money (like USD) ‚Üí value stays stable.
  They allow safe payments, trading, lending, and borrowing in DeFi.
  Reduce the risk of losing money due to crypto price swings.

  # What is Stable coins
  A stable coin is a crypto asset whose buying power stays relatively stable. Unlike bitcoin or ethereum the value does not swing up or down so much


# Examples:
## 1
Imagine Alice wants to pay for her groceries with crypto:
She owns 1 ETH.
Today, 1 ETH = $2,000 ‚Üí enough to buy groceries.
Tomorrow, ETH crashes to $1,500 ‚Üí now her grocery payment lost $500 in value.
üí° Problem: Cryptos like ETH, BTC are too volatile for everyday payments or savings.
Now, if Alice uses a stablecoin (like USDC or your stablecoin):
1 stablecoin = $1, always.
She pays $50 worth of stablecoins ‚Üí value stays $50 regardless of market swings.

## 2
üîπ Step 1: Deposit Collateral ‚Üí Mint Stablecoin
Alice has 1 ETH = $2,000.
She wants to mint stablecoins.
Rule: System requires 150% collateral ratio (safety margin).
So with $2,000 ETH, Alice can mint up to $1,333 stablecoins.
Why not full $2,000? ‚Üí To protect against ETH price drops.

üîπ Step 2: Use Stablecoins
Alice spends or invests her 1,333 stablecoins.
These stablecoins stay pegged to $1 each because they are backed by ETH collateral.

üîπ Step 3: Repay & Burn
Later, Alice wants her ETH back.
She must repay 1,333 stablecoins + small interest/fee.
Smart contract burns those stablecoins.
Alice gets back her 1 ETH collateral.

üîπ Step 4: What if ETH Price Drops? (Liquidation)
Suppose ETH falls from $2,000 ‚Üí $1,500.
Alice‚Äôs collateral = $1,500.
But her debt = $1,333 stablecoins.
Now collateral ratio = 112%, below the safe limit (150%).
This is risky ‚Üí system must act!

üîπ Step 5: Liquidation (How Others Profit)
The protocol opens liquidation.
Another user (Bob) can pay Alice‚Äôs debt of 1,333 stablecoins.
In return, Bob gets Alice‚Äôs ETH at a discount (say 5‚Äì10%).
Example: Bob repays 1,333 stablecoins and gets $1,400 worth of ETH.
Bob makes $67 profit, and system stays safe.

üîπ Why This Works
Alice‚Äôs debt is cleared (stablecoins burned).
Bob makes profit by buying discounted ETH.
System stays stable because every stablecoin in circulation is still fully backed by collateral.
‚úÖ Summary in Simple Words:
Deposit collateral ‚Üí Mint stablecoins.
Repay stablecoins ‚Üí Get collateral back.
If collateral drops too much ‚Üí Liquidation happens.
Other users repay the debt and earn profit from collateral discount.
This keeps the stablecoin safe and always pegged near $1.

  # categories and properties
   *** Relative stability ***
   *** stablity Method ***
   *** collateral type ***

## Relative stability 
  ### Pegged/Anchored Stablecoins :
     value is tied to something else, usually the us dollar
     ex: USDC ,USDT , DAI
  ### Floating 
   Not pegged to one asset instead algorithms keep their buying power steady overtime 
   ex:RAI not pegged but tries to keep its value stable with some math

## Stability Method 
 ### Governed : 
  humans or organiztion decide when coins are creasted (minted) or destoryed (burned)
  ex: USDC USDT (circle and tether control them)
 ### Algorithmic :
 controlled by code not the people 
 algorithm automatically mint / burn coin to keep value stable
 ex: UST ,DAI

 ## Collateral Type
  collateral mean swhat backs the stable coin
  ### Exogenous collateral
   outside assets , backed by real world money or external assests 
   ex: usdc -> backed buy real dollar bank 
   if usdc fails the us dollar is itill fine
   DAI -> backed by ETH & other cryptocurriences
 ### Endogenous collateral (inside the system)
  backed by tokens created inside the same protocol
   ex :ust was backed by LUNA - when UST fails LUNA fails too


# Top Stable coins
 1. DAI -> pegged algorithmic and exo
 2. USDC -> pegged governed and exo
 3. UST & LUNA -> pegged algo endo
 4. FRAX ->pegged algo hybrid
 5. RAI -> floating Algo exo


# Design of Stable coin we are going to create
1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged to the US Dollar
   Chainlink Pricefeed
   Function to convert ETH & BTC to USD
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting/Burning): Algorithmicly Decentralized
   Users may only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   wETH
   wBTC


# Working
User deposits collateral (wETH / wBTC) ‚Üí collateral is locked in the protocol.
User mints stablecoins up to a safe collateralization ratio (e.g., 150%).
Stablecoins circulate ‚Äî user can spend, lend, or provide liquidity.
Protocol constantly checks collateral ratio using Chainlink price feeds.
If ratio falls below liquidation threshold (e.g., 120%) ‚Üí protocol allows liquidation.
Liquidator repays debt (stablecoins) and receives collateral at a discounted price (liquidation bonus).
Stablecoins used to repay debt are burned. Collateral transferred to liquidator.
If user repays full debt + fees, they call burn & withdraw ‚Üí stablecoins burned, collateral released.

| Total collateral (USD) | Collateral % (threshold) | Debt you‚Äôre allowed |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| \$10,000               | 80%                      | \$8,000             |
| \$10,000               | 60%                      | \$6,000             |
| \$10,000               | 90%                      | \$9,000             |


# Token
A token is just a digital asset created on top of a blockchain.
It isn‚Äôt the main coin of that blockchain ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs made with smart contracts.

## ERC

ERC = Ethereum Request for Comment.

It‚Äôs a proposal that defines how smart contracts should behave so that wallets, DEXs, and other dApps can interact with them consistently.

Once approved by the community, it becomes a formal Ethereum standard.

Think of ERCs like USB specifications for hardware: if everyone follows the same plug standard, everything works together.

## Main erc standards
| ERC          | Purpose                                          | Examples               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **ERC-20**   | Fungible tokens (all units are interchangeable). | USDC, DAI, LINK        |
| **ERC-721**  | Non-fungible tokens (NFTs, unique IDs).          | CryptoPunks, Bored Ape |
| **ERC-1155** | Multi-asset contract (can hold fungible + NFTs). | Game items (Enjin)     |
| **ERC-4626** | Tokenized vaults/yield-bearing assets.           | Yearn vault shares     |
| **ERC-777**  | Advanced fungible token (hooks, operator model). | Some DeFi tokens       |

 

# Relationship between stable coin and erc20

1Ô∏è‚É£ A stablecoin is just a token
On Ethereum, stablecoins aren‚Äôt special coins built into the blockchain ‚Äî they‚Äôre smart contracts that track who owns how many units.

To make them work everywhere, developers build them as ERC-20 tokens.

2Ô∏è‚É£ ERC-20 = a shared rulebook

ERC-20 defines a few basic functions every wallet and app understands:

balanceOf(address) ‚Üí check how many tokens someone owns

transfer(address, amount) ‚Üí send tokens

approve(spender, amount) & transferFrom() ‚Üí let apps move your tokens with permission

If you follow these rules, any ERC-20 wallet or exchange can read balances and send your token without extra coding.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Stablecoin-specific logic

On top of ERC-20‚Äôs basic rules, the contract adds:

Mint ‚Üí create new tokens when someone deposits dollars/crypto

Burn ‚Üí destroy tokens when someone redeems

Collateral checks / price oracles ‚Üí keep value close to $1

So the ‚Äústable‚Äù part is just extra code ‚Äî the token interface stays standard.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Why that matters

Your token automatically works with:

Wallet apps (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)

DEXs (Uniswap, Curve)

Lending protocols (Aave, Compound)

Payment gateways

No one has to write a custom integration for your stablecoin.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Without ERC-20

If you invented your own custom interface, every wallet/exchange would need to learn it first ‚Äî most wouldn‚Äôt bother.

Adoption would be slow or impossible.

# CodeFlow
## DecentralizedStableCoin.sol
  It consist of two functions mint and burn function to burn and mint the token
## DSCEngine
  *** constructor ***: The DSC Engine constructor takes the arry of token  address (address of collateral token (wetgh and wbtc)) and their priceFeeds and address of dsc
  *** Functions ***
  1. depositCollateral : 
      - It takes token address and amount to be keep as collateral
      - It transfers token collateral from the msg.sender to our contract address
      - this way msg.sender deposit collateral to contract
  2. mintDsc : 
      - amountDscToMint The amount of DSC you want to mint . You can only mint DSC if you have  enough collateral
      - It takes amountDscToMint 
      - we check revert if healthfactor is low using ***_revertIfHealthFactorIsBroken(msg.sender)*** of msg.sender
   


   
  
# Important topics

 ## liquidation working 
 User deposited $100 in collateral and mints $50 in DSC

Collateral value falls to $75, breaking the user's Health Factor (0.75)

A liquidator burns $50 in DSC to close the position

The liquidator is rewarded $75 in collateral

The liquidator has profited $25
